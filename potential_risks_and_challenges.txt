After conducting research on the potential threats of AI in the context of global weapons of mass destruction disarmament, the following potential risks and challenges were identified:

1. The development of AI-controlled weaponry with a potential for mass destruction could threaten the continued effectiveness of existing disarmament policies.
2. The diffuse nature of AI technology and its dual-use applications pose challenges for arms control.
3. The potential for AI to contribute to global catastrophic risk, particularly in the intersection of military AI and nuclear weapons.
4. The potential for AI to be used in the development of deepfakes and other forms of misinformation that could contribute to the proliferation of WMDs.
5. The need for international cooperation and coordination in the development and implementation of AI-related disarmament policies.

It is important to address these potential risks and challenges in the development and implementation of the UN policy for the disarmament of global weapons of mass destruction.
