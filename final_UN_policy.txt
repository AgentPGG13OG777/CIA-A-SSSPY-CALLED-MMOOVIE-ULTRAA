2. A UN-led international monitoring and verification mechanism will be established to oversee the dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction.

3. Transparency and accountability measures will be put in place to ensure the effective implementation of disarmament commitments.

4. The development and use of emerging technologies that could be used to create weapons of mass destruction will be prevented.

5. Civil society and non-governmental organizations will be engaged in promoting disarmament and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
